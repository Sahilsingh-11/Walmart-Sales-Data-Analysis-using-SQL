This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of Walmart's retail sales using SQL. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights into store performance, seasonal trends, and the impact of external factors like holidays and fuel prices on sales.

🔍 Project Overview
Using SQL queries on Walmart's historical sales dataset, I explored:

Total and average weekly sales

Store-wise performance comparisons

Holiday vs non-holiday sales patterns

The effect of economic indicators (e.g., fuel prices, unemployment) on sales

Seasonal trends across different time frames

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / SSMS

Excel / CSV as data source

📈 Key Techniques
Data cleaning and transformation

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, etc.)

Joins across multiple datasets

Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)

CTEs and subqueries

Grouping and filtering with GROUP BY and WHERE

📊 Key Insights
Top-performing stores identified based on average weekly sales

Holiday seasons show mixed impact on sales depending on the occasion

Larger stores tend to generate higher sales, with more fluctuation

Sales trends are strongly seasonal, peaking around Q4

External factors like fuel prices slightly influence customer spending

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to derive actionable insights from real-world retail data. It highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving store performance and planning inventory and marketing strategies.
